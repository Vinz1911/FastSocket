/// written on top of TCP. It's a message based protocol which allows you
/// to send text and binary based messages. The protocol is so small it have
/// only 10 Bytes overhead per message, the handshake is done directly on TCP level.
/// The motivation behind this protocol was, to use it as `Speedtest Protocol`, a
/// low level TCP communication protocol to measure TCP throughput performance. -> FastSocket is the answer
/// FastSocket allows to enter all possible TCP Options if needed and is completely non-blocking and async, thanks to GCD
